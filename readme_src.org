* About
Oxidized rust re-implementation of [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/readCon][readCon]].
** Usage
#+begin_src bash
cargo run -- resources/test/sulfolene.con
#+end_src
** Design Decisions
The library is designed with the following principles in mind:

- *Lazy Parsing:* The ~ConFrameIterator~ allows for lazy parsing of frames, which can be more memory-efficient when dealing with large trajectory files.

- *Interoperability:* The FFI layer makes the core parsing logic accessible from other programming languages, increasing the library's utility. Currently, a ~C~ header is auto-generated along with a hand-crafted ~C++~ interface, following the hourglass design from [[https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor][Metatensor]].
** Specification
Currently this implements the ~con~ format specification as written out by eON,
so some assumptions are made about the input files, not all of which are
currently tested / guaranteed to throw (contributions are welcome for additional
sanity checks).
*** Single Frames
- The first 9 lines are the header
- The remaining lines can be inferred from the header
*** Multiple Frames
Often, as for example when running a Nudged Elastic Band, ~eON~ will write out
multiple units of ~con~ like data into a single file.
- The ~con~ like data *have no whitespace between them*!

That is we expect:

Nothing else. No whitespace or lines between the ~con~ entries.
** Why use this over [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/readCon][readCon]]?
To learn Rust. Maybe speed.
